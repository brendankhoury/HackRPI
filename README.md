## Inspiration
Car emmissions are a significant contributor to bad air quality and climate change. In urban enviornments, 50 to 90 percent of bad air quality can be attributed to cars (https://auto.howstuffworks.com/percentage-of-air-pollution-due-to-cars.htm). We sought to solve this problem by enabling safe carpooling.

## What it does
CarpoolCoordinator is exactly what it sounds like. To signup, simply enter your login details, work address, home address, and your work schedule. It then shows you a list of people who live nearby and work at the same location, it also gives contact details. Carpooling with strangers is a safety issue so the only people who are shown are people who work at your work (verified by email domain).

## How we built it
We built it using a React front-end, Flask back-end, CockroachDB database for user data, Google Cloud for hosting CockroachDB, and IBMCloud foundry for hosting the application. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges with setting up some of the cloud infrastructure.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the idea we created. Being able to see collegues that live near you and carpool with them could enable many people to save money and the enviornment.

## What we learned
We all learned about CockroachDB as well as how to navigate some of the cloud infrastructure. We also improved upon our prexsisting JS and Python skills. We also learned about how react handles forms. 

## What's next for Carpool Coordinator
Ideally we would improve the signin functionality and facilitate conversations within an app. We'd also like to enable larger companies to host their own version of the site for their employees.
